## Blue Zones ##
#### ...are geographical areas characterized by above-average life expectancies and qualitatively better life experiences. In [a June 2004 Journal of Experimental Gerontology paper](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00175541/document),researchers Poulain, Pes, Grasland, et.al., observed the phenomenon in the Ogliastra region of Sardinia. Since then, similar results have been observed in Okinanwa - Japan, Nicoya - Costa Rica, and Ikaria Greece.
#### The "Bee Blue Zones" project is designed to identify _where and why_ global honey bee populations are thriving. The implications of this research are most noticeably relevant to the subjects of food security and agricultrual stability.
The research is being conducted through the [Urban Beekeeping Laboratory and Bee Sanctuary](https://urbanbeelab.org/).
