This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

 
```{r}
# read appropriate libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```
```{r}
# read the harvest file
df_2017 <- read_csv("csv_harvest_tog.csv",col_names = c("fHiveID","fInvoiceID","fRegionID","fVisitID","pHarvestID","BottleCount","BottleSize","BottleType","BottleDate","DeliverDate","HarvestDate","Field55","Title","Weight","WeigthRunning","HarvestStatus","ClosedFlag","duplicateHarvestStatus","HarvestYear","duplicateClientID","Cluster","inhouseHiveID","HiveID","Address","City","HiveName","State","Zipcode","ClientID","CompanyName","LastName","FullName"), col_types = cols(
    fHiveID=col_number(),
    fInvoiceID=col_number(),
    fRegionID=col_number(),
    fVisitID=col_number(),
    pHarvestID=col_number(),
    BottleCount=col_number(),
    BottleSize=col_number(),
    BottleType=col_character(),
    BottleDate=col_character(),
    DeliverDate=col_character(),
    HarvestDate=col_character(),
    Field55=col_skip(),
    Title=col_character(),
    Weight=col_number(),
    WeightRunning=col_number(),
    HarvestStatus=col_character(),
    ClosedFlag=col_character(),
    duplicateHarvestStatus=col_character(),
    HarvestYear=col_character(),
    duplicateClientID=col_integer(),
    Cluster=col_character(),
    inhouseHiveID=col_integer(),
    HiveID=col_integer(),
    Address=col_character(),
    City=col_character(),
    HiveName=col_character(),
    State=col_character(),
    Zipcode=col_character(),
    ClientID=col_number(),
    CompanyName=col_character(),
    LastName=col_character(),
    FullName=col_character()
),skip = 1)

```

```{r}
# Pare down df_2017 to essential columns,rename them, port result to df object
df <- select(df_2017,HiveID,Title,HarvestYear,HarvestDate,Weight,HarvestID=pHarvestID,VisitID=fVisitID) 
head(df,20)
tail(df,20)
```

```{r}
# Subset missing NA's by Title to get an idea of cleanup
missing_na <- df %>% summarize(MissingHiveID=sum(is.na(HiveID)),MissingTitle=sum(is.na(Title)),MissingYear=sum(is.na(HarvestYear)),MissingDate=sum(is.na(HarvestDate)))
missing_na
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.
```{r}
# Identify the number of harvests in 2017 with positive Weight figures
# y_2017 is the working dataframe

y_2017 <- df_2017 %>% filter(HarvestYear == "2017" & Weight >0) %>% arrange(desc(Weight))
y_2017
```
```{r}

```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
